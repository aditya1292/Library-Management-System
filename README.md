     </div>


# Description
The provided code is an implementation of a Library Management System using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to perform various tasks related to library management, such as adding books, deleting books, viewing the book list, issuing books to students, and returning books.  The project aims to provide a graphical user interface that simplifies the management of books in a library. It utilizes a MySQL database to store and retrieve book information, including details like book ID, title, author, and status (whether the book is available or issued).  The main features of the project include:  1. Add Book: Users can enter the book details, such as book ID, title, author, and status, and add them to the library database.  2. Delete Book: Users can delete a book from the library by providing the book ID.  3. View Book List: Users can view the list of books present in the library database, including book ID, title, author, and status.  4. Issue Book to Student: Users can issue a book to a student by providing the book ID and the student's name. The status of the book will be updated accordingly.  5. Return Book: Users can return a book that was issued to a student by providing the book ID. The status of the book will be updated to available.  The code connects to the MySQL database, performs database operations such as inserting, deleting, and updating records, and displays the user interface using Tkinter. However, please note that the provided code is incomplete and lacks some necessary components like database table structures and error handling for database operations.  Overall, the project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing library operations and facilitating tasks related to book management, issuance, and returns.
